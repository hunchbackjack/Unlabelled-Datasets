Datasets created using sklearnâ€™s make_classification method [Pedregosa et al. 2011]. 30 datasets were created that produced a random number of samples, ranging from 500 to 2,000, with a random number of features, ranging from 50 to 200. The exact characteristics of each dataset can be found in their corresponding .md files.
